Turns out I should learn the language first. Mostly adapted from 'a tour of Go' (tour.golang.org)

Stuff I'm surprised about:
- "" =! ''
- walrus operator
- enforced trailing commas

Stuff I like:
- functions returning any number of results
- named return values

Stuff I don't like:
- variable declaration syntax
- random not behaving as you might expect
